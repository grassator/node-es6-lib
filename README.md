This just a starter project for CommonJS library with ES6 features that currently supported by Node.

The reason I created this is that I wanted simple and easy to start setup for whenever
I want to work on something with JavaScript and not for the browser. Webpack, code coverage,
and all the bells and whistles can always be added later.
